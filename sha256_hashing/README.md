# Basic SHA256 Hashing using Python

Hashing is an important aspect of cryptography, it ensures the integrity of data. The standard python modules includes an easy solution for hashing called `hashlib`

## There are two types of hashing
1. Plaintext/string hashing
2. File hashing

## Plaintext/string hashing

A simple conversion of a normal string of text into a hashed value via a hashing function.


## File hashing

Converts the binary byte value of a file into a hashed value.

A single file called `python_logo.png` has been included as a control to compare hashes.
